INTRODUCTION
------------

BankApp is a program that lets users simulate a bank account. The user starts with $0 and can deposit, withdraw, and view previous transactions. The program starts by giving the user 4 different options to choose from. The first one initiates the deposit process, the second one initiates the withdrawal process, the third one displays the latest transaction, and the last one is to exit the program. The program will not allow any illogical actions to be performed (i.e. trying to withdraw with a balance of $0 or less). The program loops around this menu choice until the user decides to exit.

- Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse)
